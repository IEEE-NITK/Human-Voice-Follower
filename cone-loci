Cone localization algorithm : 

4 mics are arranged at the vertices of a square of side 2*a. The horizontal pairs and vertical pairs of mics are used to constitute 4 loci of cones.
the x y co-ordinates of the intersection of the loci will give the same of the sound source. 

the angle of the cones is obtained by delay between 2 mics of every pair.
